# Health Economics

## Key points

- Health economics helps to inform how best to use healthcare resources
- Considering opportunity cost is important to understanding whether we are making the right choices
- To achieve value for money we have to do things right (technical efficiency) and do the right things (allocative efficiency)
- Considering marginal effects means we assess the true impact of resource changes, taking into account diminishing marginal returns
- But, economic efficiency will not necessarily deliver an equitable solution! Equity should be considered on top of economic evidence

## Aims

- Explain what health economics is
- Define the central ideas and principles of health economics
- Help students start to think where they can apply economics in the healthcare decisions they make or support

## Health Economics

### Definitions

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Health Economics | Looks to inform choices over how scare resources are used to maximise health outcomes |
| Scarcity | Fundamental concept in economics<br>>People's wants are unlimited, but the resources to satisfy those wants are not |
| Cost effective | When effects expected are worth the change in costs |
| Opportunity Cost | Benefits forgone from the next best alternative that was not chosen due to scarse resources<br>By assessing this can really think about the trade offs that have to be made in order to make the best decision<br>E.g. deciding on whether to fund weight change management vs stop smoking, if weight change is chosen then opportunity cost is missed benefits of stop smoking service |

## Efficiency

### Definitions

Can exist independantly of each other. A service can be using resources in a technically inefficient way but that service may be providing a greater impact on society so is allocatively efficient.

| Term | Definition | Can be increased by: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Technical Efficiency | Maximum output from a given set of inputs | Achieving more with same resources<br>Achieve the same with fewer resources
| Allocative Efficiency | Doing the right things so resources are put to their most rewarding use in society | Re-allocation of resources to services that have a greater impact on society |

## Marginal Returns

> The change we would expect to see taking into account that the relationship between inputs and outputs may not be linear
> Doubling the budget of a service may not lead to double outcomes
> Halving the budget may not lead to a decline to half outcomes

### Law of diminishing marginal returns

> As quantity of resources are increased the additional gain will become smaller
> The subsequent changes (allocation/removal) of resource will have a larger impact than any of the prior changes

> Disinvestment at any level can have distorting effects if people with certain characteristics, like being more deprived, are the first to stop receiving help. This raises equity issues which should be considered.

## Resource allocation

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Programme budgeting | Understand current situation in the locality in terms of assessing spending and achivement of investment<br>Break down into meaningfyl categories<br>Capture outcomes in single measure, but likely not possible. |
| Marginal Analysis | Understanding effects of a change in budget<br>Evidence based judgement. Evidence not usually available so group decision taking into account impacts of other programmes/services |

### PBMA process

1. Break down you activity into meaningful programme areas
1. Identify the current expenditure and outcomes of those programmes
1. Think of changes that could be made to how resources are allocated
1. Look to understand and assess how changes in budgets result in changes in outcomes
1. Consult widely with knowledgeable stakeholders to make sure there is nothing you have missed
1. Decide on the best course of actions
1. Put the changes into effect
1. Evaluate progress

### Assessment

| Question | Responses | Answer | Correct |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Statements about health economics | acheiving best value for money from healthcare budgets<br>satisfying as manay health needs as possible<br>evidence is just one of many considersations when making decisions<br>weight costs against benefits | one of many considerations | **All statements** |
| Fundamental problem in health economics | Scarcity<br>Opportunity Costs<br>Measuring Marginal Change<br>Equity | Scarcity | Scarcity |
| Person has option X or Y. They went with X so opportunity cost is benefits missed by not picking Y. What are expected value of opportunity cost to be smaller than benefits observed from their choice X | Diminishing Marginal Returns<br>Value of an opportunity cost is always zero<br>If oppportunity cost was larger than benefits from X then person would have been better picking Y<br>Choice shows allocative efficiency | Benefits from X outweight opportunity cost of Y | Benefits from X outweight opportunity cost of Y |
| Marginal effects are those that | Are so small they don't matter<br>Reflect changes made in the past<br>Represent the true effect of the decisions made, taking into account the possible non-linear relationship of cost and effect<br>are felt by those on margins of society | the long one | the long one |
|Imagine a situation where the outcomes of a substance abuse counselling service are known under two funding situations:<br>Situation 1 - Budget of £100,000 and 1,000 people are provided counselling<br>Situation 2 - Budget of £200,000 and 1,500 people are provided counselling<br>If diminishing marginal returns applies to the service, how many people would be expected to receive counselling from a budget of £150,000? | < 1000<br>1000 - 1250<br>1250<br>1250 - 1500<br> > 1500 | 1250 - 1500 | 1250 - 1500 |
| A Local Authority provides a service to support people living with HIV to optimally manage their treatment and cope with the emotional and physiological impact of their condition. Currently those wishing to attend must phone the centre and book a place. Switching to an online booking system would save money while still maintaining the same level of service. | Scarcity<br>Technical Efficiency<br>Allocative Efficiency<br>Diminishing Marginal Returns | Technical efficiency | Technical Efficiency |
| In a meeting a colleague says that your area should be aiming for greater allocative efficiency in the provision of a under 18 weight management service. Why is this statement wrong? | Allocative efficiency is a concept to help inform decisions across programmes not services<br>Weight management for under 18s is not a priority<br>Weight management service already shows allocative efficiency<br>To do so would raise intergenrational equity issues | Inform decisions across programmes | Inform decisions across programmes |
|PBMA is a technique that can be used to acheive allocative efficiency | Programme Budgeting Marginal Analysis | Programme Budgeting Marginal Analysis | Programme Budgeting Marginal Analysis |
