## Learning Outcomes

- Discuss the role and importance of medicine formularies.
- Explain the aims and objectives of Shared Care Agreements and when and why they may be necessary.
- Describe the role of Independent Prescribers (IP) and Supplementary Prescribers (SP).
- Describe the function of Patient Group Directions (PGDs). 

## Key Points

- Incidents frequently occur due to a breakdown in communication between healthcare professionals in the acute care setting and as a result of poor documentation.
- Prescribing incidents are commonly reported at the interface between primary and secondary care.
- A range of non-medical healthcare professionals can prescribe medicines for patients as Independent or Supplementary prescribers following completion of appropriate training (BNF, 2019).
- A Patient Group Direction is a written instruction for the supply and/or administration of a named licensed medicine for a defined clinical condition.
- Shared Care Agreements' (SCAs) are “a specific approach to the seamless prescribing and monitoring of medicines which enable patients to receive care in an integrated and convenient manner. Shared care is a particular form of the transfer of clinical responsibility from a hospital or specialist service to general practice in which prescribing by the GP, or other primary care prescriber, is supported by a shared care agreement” (NHS England, 2018).
- Patients should not be used as the primary channel of communication for informing the GP that changes to prescribing arrangements (e.g. shared care agreements) or prescribed treatment regimens have occurred.
- Patient should not be left in a situation where they are unable to get access to medicines as a result of communication breakdown between primary and secondary care.
- You have an important role in communicating decisions effectively to ensure safe prescribing for your patients.

## Formularies

Aim to:

1. Restrict the range of medicines available, allowing increased familiarity with a small range of products.
2. Encourage evidenced-based prescribing.
3. Encourage cost effective prescribing.
4. Reduce untried medicines gaining widespread use.

## Shared Care Agreements

> “Shared Care Agreements' (SCAs) are a specific approach to the seamless prescribing and monitoring of medicines which enable patients to receive care in an integrated and convenient manner. Shared care is a particular form of the transfer of clinical responsibility from a hospital or specialist service to general practice in which prescribing by the GP, or other primary care prescriber, is supported by a shared care agreement” (NHS England, 2018). 

- Shared care agreements formalise the relationship between the secondary care consultant and the GP.
- When a consultant considers that a patient’s condition is stable or predictable, s/he may seek agreement with a GP (and the patient) to share the care.
- In the shared care agreement, the consultant should advise the GP on:
  - the medicine(s) to prescribe (including dose and route of administration)
  - what monitoring needs to occur in primary care
  - how often the medicine(s) should be reviewed
  - the appropriate action to take if difficulties are encountered. 
- Patients should not be used as the channel for informing the GP that prescribing arrangements are to change or left in a situation where they are unable to get medication as a result of a lack of communication between primary and secondary care.
