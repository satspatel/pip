# Prescribing in infection

## Learning Outcomes

- Describe the different classes of antibacterials available and their site of action on a microorganism.
- Describe how bacteria can develop resistance to antibacterials.
- Counsel patients who are prescribed an antibacterial in order to minimise the risk of harm and to support adherence.
- Explain why certain antibacterials might be restricted in a Trust, and how access to them could be obtained.
- Know where to look for guidelines on treating infections and why adherence to these is important.

## Key Points

- Antimicrobial Prescribing and Stewardship (APS) competencies have been developed by Public Health England with the aim to:
    1. reduce the risks of inadequate, inappropriate and ill-effects of treatment
    2. improve the safety and quality of patient care
    3. contribute to the reduction in emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance.
- Start Smart - then Focus.
- Where possible, local and/or national guidelines should be adhered to when prescribing antibacterials empirically.
- Antimicrobials should be reviewed and 'focused' as soon as microbiology culture and sensitivity results are available.
- Intravenous antimicrobials can often be switched to the oral route after 48-72 hours if the patient has improved clinically and can tolerate oral medication. Most Trusts have policies to help you with this.
- It is good antimicrobial stewardship to clearly document the reason or 'indication' for prescribing an antimicrobial on the prescription and in the medical/clinical notes.
- Antibacterials may be restricted because of their broad spectrum of activity (to preserve efficacy), because they are considered high-risk, or they are high cost, or both.
- The duty Microbiologist can advise on complicated cases, but can only provide the best advice when provided with accurate and up-to-date information about the patient, for example travel history within the last 12 months, recent antibacterial therapy, clinical history, recent hospitalisation and previous positive microbiology (including positive screening results).

## Antimicrobial Resistance

Key drivers in the development of antimicrobial resistance include:

- Patients not taking prescribed antimicrobials as directed (e.g. not completing the prescribed course)
- Poor hygiene practices in healthcare settings
- Poor personal hygiene practices
- Indiscriminate or inappropriate use of antimicrobials (in humans and animals)
- Lack of new antimicrobials being developed

### Start SMART then FOCUS

| start SMART | then FOCUS |
| --- | --- |
| Obtain cultures prior to starting treatment where appropriate (but treatment should not be delayed)<br>Take a drug allergy history<br>Start antimicrobials within ONE hour of recognition of Red Flag sepsis, septic shock or life threatening infections<br>Comply with local antimicrobial prescribing guidelines<br>Document the indication for treatment, severity of the infection, dose, route and frequency on both the prescription and in the medical notes<br>State a review or stop date<br>Consult the Microbiologist and/or Antimicrobial Pharmacist for advice where appropriate<br> | At 48-72 hours, review the patient and make (and document) the management plan, including the next review or stop date. The following are possible management plans at 48-72 hours of antimicrobial therapy:<br>Stop treatment (i.e. if no evidence of infection)<br>Switch from intravenous to oral treatment.<br>Change the antimicrobial.<br>Continue current treatment.<br>Refer for Outpatient Parenteral Antibiotic Therapy (OPAT).|

## Spectrums of Activity

### Gram staining

| Characteristic | Gram Negative | Gram Positive |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cell wall | Dual Membrane | Single Membrane |
| Peptidoglycan layer | Thin | Thick |
| Gram stain | Destained | Retains Stain |
| Colour | Pink | Purple |

### Targets

#### Cell Wall

**Bacteriocidal** - cell wall damage leads to cell death

- Beta-lactam antibacterials (e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems) inhibit cell wall formation and result in rapid killing of the organism.
- Glycopeptide antibacterials (e.g. vancomycin and teicoplanin) inhibit a different stage of cell wall formation, and when given in high concentrations cause cell death.

#### Protein Synthesis inhibition

**Bacteriostatic** - preventing cellular growth and division

- Macrolides (e.g. clarithromycin)
- Tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline)

 - they inhibit protein synthesis, stopping the cell from growing. 
Bacteriostatic agents do not kill the cell, but allow host defences to deal with the infection.

####Â Quinolones interfere with DNA synthesis.

#### Metronidazole damages bacterial DNA, and is only active against anaerobic bacteria.

#### Trimethoprim interferes with bacterial folate metabolism, resulting in a lack of purine analogues for DNA synthesis.

#### Daptomycin binds to bacterial membranes, leading to depolarisation of the membrane, causing rapid inhibition of protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis, and therefore cell death.

### Bacterial defences

- **Efflux pumps** can pump any antibacterial which has passed through the outer membrane back out before they reach the target site (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa)
- **Antibacterial-modifying enzymes** destroy the antibacterial before it reaches its target within the cell (e.g. beta-lactamase or aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes)
- **Mutations in the target site** of an antibacterial prevent it binding; Meticillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has altered its cell wall to prevent binding of beta-lactam antibiotics

## Treatment Selection

### Factors

- National/local antimicrobial prescribing guidelines
- Spectrum of antimicrobial activity (e.g. broad-spectrum vs narrow spectrum)
- Site of infection
- Cultures and sensitivities. If the causative organism is unknown, consider the type of organism most likely to be causing the infection at a particular site
- Patient factors (e.g. allergies, age, drug history, co-morbidities, contraindications to treatment)
- Route of administration
- Duration of treatment/intended review date

### Empirical Antibiotics

When a patient presents with an infection, in the majority of cases we do not know what the causative organism is.

It is important to treat empirically, usually with a broad-spectrum antibacterial to cover all the most common causative organisms. 

### Culture results

Should guide which agents are suitable, but bear in mind kinetics of the agents, will they reach the site of infection?

### Micro advice

Should provide:

- Any known previous colonisation and/or infection with an organism with antibacterial susceptibilities.
- Any known allergies - especially to antibacterials.
- Any recent hospitalisation (other hospitals may harbour different organisms to yours).
- Any recent procedures or surgery.
- Any obvious source of current infection.

### Documentation

- Indication for antibacterials in the notes and on the drug chart (for continuity of care). In cases where there is a confidential diagnosis (e.g. HIV positive), annotate the prescription with 'see notes for indication'.
- Intended route and duration (review or stop date, plus any intended change from intravenous to oral formulations).

## Safe Prescribing

Correct:

- drug (allergy status, appropriateness)
- dose within therapeutic range (renal function)
- timing
  - urgency for first dose
  - even spacing for subsequent doses
- route (48 hour IV to oral switch)
- duration
  - review dates appropriate

## Descalation

As per Focus earlier

## Restricted

## Rationale

- They are broad-spectrum agents, where inappropriate use would promote development of resistance.
- They need to be reserved for serious infections where multi-drug resistant organisms are known to be present or are suspected.
- They may be potentially toxic, and their use may be limited in duration or they require specialist monitoring.
- They may be expensive, and inappropriate use may waste limited resources.
