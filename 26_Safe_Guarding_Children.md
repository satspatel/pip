## Importance of safeguarding

### Legal considerations

The law in the UK has been developed to ensure that the rights of children are a priority and that children's voices are heard. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC 1989) identifies that children have the right to be protected from being hurt and mistreated whether physically or mentally.

The UNCRC encourages all international governments to ensure that children are cared for with dignity and respect, are protected from violence, abuse and neglect by anyone who comes into contact with them.

Other key elements include:

- The right to survival
- The right to develop to the fullest potential
- The right to participate fully in family, cultural and social life
- The right to health and healthcare
- The right to protection from all forms of violence

### What is safeguarding

> Protecting children from abuse and maltreatment
> Preventing harm to children's health or development
> Ensuring children grow up with provision of safe and effective care

Situations considered as abuse, maltreatment or harm:

- Grooming which includes abusive and sexual conduct over the Internet
- Cyber abuse
- Indoctrination of a child or young person into an ideology or mindset where they believe that the only way to have their voice heard is to commit crime, abuse others, become racist or xenophobic, hate others, and inflict phycological or physical harm to others
