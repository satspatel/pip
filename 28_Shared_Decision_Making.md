## Definitions

### Patient Centred Care

- meets the person’s needs and priorities **before** those of the system or its professionals
- engages people in their care as fully as possible
- support people to take decisions and to be as much in control as possible

## Pathways

Shared Decision Making is appropriate when:

- There is a decision to be made for which a number of valid and realistic options exist
- The options have comparable outcomes which can be demonstrated
- The choice depends upon the preference of the patient

Patients should be encouraged to take into account their values, preferences and beliefs. This is called a ‘preference-sensitive decision’.

Examples of preference sensitive decisions include:

- Breast conserving therapy or mastectomy for early breast cancer
- Hip replacement surgery or exercise/pain relief
- Diet and weight loss or medication in diabetes

1. Highlight that a decision needs to be made
1. Outline different treatments/options
1. Gather information
1. Share information


### Information Gathering

The information flow needs to be two-way, from patient to clinician and from clinician to patient.

Patients like to receive information in a variety of formats (e.g. discussion, printed, visual images/charts, videos. etc). Developing a repository of information formats is therefore very useful.

### Sharing the information

Sharing information about a treatment option needs to be balanced, unbiased and discussed alongside the patient's views, values, goals and preferences. Questions that can be used to elicit this information are:

- What do you understand about your condition?
- What are your goals and priorities for your treatment?
- Had you any specific expectations about the treatments for you?
- Have you any concerns, everything is important to discuss if it matters to you?

## Mental Capacity Act

- A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that they lack capacity
- A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success
- A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision
- An act done, or decision made, under this Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or made, in his best interests
- Before the act is done, or the decision is made, regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is least restrictive of the persons rights and freedom of action
