# Dosing and Kinetcs

## Stuff to find out

- Volume of distribution
- First Order Kinetics

## Session Key Points

- Clinical kinetics describes the processes a drug will go through to produce its clinical effect, from the moment it is administered until it is removed from the body
- Factors affecting Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Elimination govern the rate and extent of a drug's action
- Bioavailability is the extent to which a drug reaches the systemic circulation, where it is available to act at the 'effector site'
- The pharmacokinetic characteristics of a drug in the body can be defined by three parameters: the volume of distribution (Vd), half-life (t1/2) and clearance (Cl)
- Elimination half-life (t1/2) is a measure of the time taken for the plasma concentration of a drug to fall by half. The concentration falls to a quarter in two half-lives, and 1/32 (3.125%) in five half-lives - so over 95% has gone after five half-lives
- Monitoring of drug concentration can be important for drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index

## Routes of Administration

| Route | Used when |
| --- | --- |
| Parenteral | Your patient is unable to take drugs orally (vomiting)<br>A rapid onset of action is required (anaesthetic induction)<br>The drug is not available as an oral formulation (adrenaline, insulin) |
| Topical | Skin conditions (e.g. antifungal or corticosteroid cream)<br>Local anaesthetic (e.g. lidocaine with prilocaine as EMLA® cream)<br>For systemic absorption of drugs to act as a 'slow-release preparation' (e.g. nicotine patch for smoking cessation) |

## Bioavailability

> Bioavailability is the extent to which a drug reaches the systemic circulation where it is available to act at the 'effector site' (e.g. the brain for a sedative effect). When a drug is administered intravenously, it has a bioavailability of 100%.

| Factors | Impact |
| --- | --- |
| Route of administration | a drug given orally has to be absorbed in the gut before reaching the systemic circulation (e.g. carbamazepine) |
| Properties of the drug | a highly lipid-soluble drug will be absorbed better (e.g. glyceryl trinitrate) |
| Plasma-protein binding | highly protein bound drugs have less free drug to act at the receptor site (e.g. propranolol) (distribution) |
| Metabolism | drugs absorbed by the gut pass through the liver via the portal circulation where they are metabolised (e.g. benzodiazepines) |
| Elimination | a drug eliminated through the kidneys will accumulate in renal dysfunction (e.g. digoxin) |

### Parameters

![Alt Text](Images/AUC.png)

| Parameter | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Area Under the Curve (AUC) | Total dose of drug made bioavailable |
| Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) | Highest concentration acheived after administration |
| Time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) | The time taken to reach peak plasma concentration |
| Steady State Concentration | When the inflow of the drug into plasma is equal to the rate of removal |
| Half Life | The time for the plasma concentration to fall by half<br>For most drugs, the fall is related to elimination from the body and so it is called the 'elimination half-life' |
| Clearance | approximately five half-lives for 97% of the drug to be eliminated from the body |

### Patient factors affecting bioavailability

| Factor | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| GI transit time | Governs the time taken to traverse the GI system, in particular the small-intestine, which is the primary location for drug absorption<br>Postoperative ileus is common and influences enteral drug administration |
| GI pH | The pH affects the ionisation state of drugs<br>pH 1 (strongly acidic) in the stomach to pH 8 (alkaline) in the small intestine<br>Unionised drugs are absorbed better, therefore:<br>Acidic drugs (e.g. aspirin) are better absorbed in the stomach<br>Basic drugs (e.g. metoclopramide) are better absorbed in the small intestine<br>Relevant in treating patients who have had GI surgery (e.g. gastric bypass surgery or small bowel resection) |
| Concomitant drug administration | Erythromycin inhibits warfarin metabolism<br>Phenytoin increases metabolism of other antiepileptics<br>Rifampicin increases the metabolism of oestrogen in the oral contraceptive pill<br> |

### Formulation factors

| Factor | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Tablets | Formulation coatings<br>enteric coatings (EC) are designed to protect the drug from degradation along the GI tract (e.g. through pH changes)<br> MR coatings utilise these changes to control the rate of delivery and absorption of drug into the systemic circulation |
| Use of Pro-drugs | Codeine converted to Morphine<br>Azathioprine to Mercaptopurine<br>Enalapril to Enalaprilat |

## Pharmacokinetics

### Definitions

| Term | Definition | High value indicates... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Volume of Distribution | Theoretical volume of fluid that would be needed to achieve the actual plasma drug concentration<br>Drug molecules distribute outside the vascular compartment this explains why Vd is often much higher than a person's actual blood volume<br> Vd = Total amount of drug in the body (X)➗Plasma-drug concentration (Cp)| Drugs with a high Vd will have a low plasma concentration<br>Lipid Soluble<br>Distributed in Tissues |

#### Volume of Distribution

| Patient Type | Proportions | Impact on Volume of Distribution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Children | Higher percentage of total body water than adults<br>Reduces as they get older | Water soluble drugs in children will have a higher Vd. Therefore, drugs that are highly water soluble may require higher doses on a milligram per kilogram basis of body weight to achieve similar plasma concentrations.<br>Lipid soluble drugs in children will have a lower Vd |
| Pregnancy and oedema | Increase in total body water | Water soluble drugs will have a higher Vd leading to lower plasma concentrations<br>Therefore, higher doses may be needed for a given therapeutic effect.|
| Older adults and dehydrated patients | Lower percentage of total body water compared with a 'healthy' adult<br>As adults age there is generally an increase in body fat and a decrease in total body water | Water soluble drugs will have a lower Vd<br>Lipid soluble drugs will have a higher Vd. This can lead to an increase in the elimination half-life and a prolonged effect<br>Therefore, a reduced dose may be required. |

#### Compartments

| Compartment | Area |
| --- | --- |
| Central | Vascular<br>Lungs<br>Kidney<br>Muscle |
| Peripheral | Fat |

- When a drug enters the blood, it starts distributing into all perfused areas.
- Since fat is less vascular, a smaller proportion of drug enters this peripheral compartment.
- However, if you continue to give a drug over a period of time, there is time to diffuse into fat, which takes up a larger quantity of the drug due to its larger mass.
- Then when you stop giving the drug, the concentration gradient is reversed and the drug starts going into the blood from the fat, thereby maintaining serum concentrations.
- The fat acts as a reservoir of drug with 'slow release'.
- The implications of this are greater for fat soluble drugs, which tend to have long half-lives.

#### Protein Binding

Highly protein bound drugs have low volumes of distribution

Only unbound (or free) drugs can cross biological membranes and elicit a clinical response.

Measure fraction bound and fraction unbound

### Elimination Half life

Elimination half-life (t1/2) is a measure of the time taken for the plasma concentration of a drug to fall by 50%

Most of the drug, approximately 97% is eliminated after five half-lives

| Order of Kinetics | Impact | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Zero | Linear | Enzymatic processes get saturated |
| First | Exponential | |

### Clearance

> The clearance of a drug is the hypothetical volume of blood from which the drug is completely removed per unit time<br>It is expressed as units of volume per unit of time (e.g. litre/hour or ml/minute).

## Heptatic Metabolism

| Factor | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Liver function | presence of cytochrome P450 enzyme<br>Inducers and Inhibitors |
| Hepatic blood flow | can be decreased in shock and gastrointestinal surgery, affecting the amount of drug presented to the liver |

## Renal Metabolism

Excrete water soluble metabolites (produced by Liver) but also "unchanged" drugs. Impairment can cause accumulation.

## Therapeutic Drug Monitoring

Therapeutic Index/Window - effective therapeutic dose for clinical treatment and there is no risk of drug-associated toxicity.
Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs require TDM
