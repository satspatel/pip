1. Integrate improvement into current services
1. Involve all parties

#### Priorities

1. Highest Impact
1. Changeability - is change possible

| E | End of Treatment | Uncommon<br>Occurs soon after withdrawl of the drug | Opioid withdrawal |
| F | Failure | Common<br>Dose-related<br>Often caused by drug interactions | Failure of the oral contraceptive in the presence of an enzyme inducer<br>Failure of therapeutic effect in patients taking anticoagulants leading to stroke |

## Clinical governance

> A framework through which NHS organisations are accountable for continually improving the quality of their services and safeguarding high standards of care by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will flourish.

> This definition is intended to embody three key attributes: recognisably high standards of care, transparent responsibility and accountability for those standards, and a constant dynamic of improvement.

### 7 pillars of clinical governance

1. Risk management
1. Information Management

## How to improve adherence

1. Improve communication with patient and other HCPs

1. Understand patient perspective
1. Provide information

## Sepsis

### Sepsis SIX 

1. Senior review
1. O2

1. IV fluids
1. Monitoring NEWS2 - urine output and lactate

### Signs of sepsis
