## Learning Outcomes

- Describe the processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of drugs in the older patient.
- Explain how age-related physiological and pathological processes affect how the body reacts to drugs.
- Explain how physical, cognitive and social aspects may affect an older patient's ability to adhere to treatment.
- Discuss the factors that make older adults more at risk of developing Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs).
- Develop strategies to reduce problems with medicines in the older adult population.

## Key Points

- Changes in drug disposition occur with age and the main consequence is reduced excretion of water soluble drugs and metabolites.
- Older patients may have altered responsiveness to drugs (e.g. more likely to get postural hypotension with antihypertensive drugs).
- Polypharmacy is a term used to describe the use of multiple medications and/or the administration of more medications than are clinically indicated, representing unnecessary drug use.
- Adherence to treatment regimens can be a problem for older adults. Complex factors (e.g. adverse drug reactions, poor manual dexterity, cognitive impairment, polypharmacy) may mean that older patients do not take their medicines as advised.
- Adverse drug reactions are common and may account for at least 10% of hospital admissions in the older adult population.
- Drug interactions are common and are more likely to occur with polypharmacy and the use of over-the-counter medication.
- The National Service Framework for ‘Older People’ aims to ensure that patients gain maximum benefit from their medicines.  Older people should expect increased or improved quality and duration of life from their medication and should not suffer unnecessarily from illness caused by excessive, inappropriate, or inadequate consumption of medicines [DHSC 2001].

## Pharmacokinetics

Increases in age assocated with:
- Decrease in lean body mass.
- Decrease in body water.
- Increase in body fat in relation to total body weight.
- Decrease in bone mass.

### Absorption

Increased systemic exposure due to reduced liver blood flow.

### Distribution
