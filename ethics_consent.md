## Session Key Points

- For an adult patient to consent to treatment, you are required to provide information on the common or known serious adverse-effects or risks of medication.
- You should do your best to make sure that the patient has considered all the available options and reached their own decision.
- All professional staff involved in the care and treatment of an adult person who may lack capacity must keep a record of long-term or significant decisions made about mental capacity.
- No one else can make a decision on behalf of an adult who has capacity.
- Every competent patient has the right to refuse or consent to medical treatment including prescription medication. You must respect a patient's decision to refuse treatment even if you think their decision is wrong or irrational.
- GMC guidance states that you should not treat patients that you are close to.
