# Reflective Assignment

- [ ] review top tips
- [ ] think about reflective models
- [ ] just start writing first
- [ ] look at case reports for examples
- [ ] academic interviews in November
- [ ] huddersfield APA referencing sheet
- [ ] contemporaenously research

- you have asssessed patient not been a bystander
- 30 - 40 references (need to look at primary data)!!

- what did you do, why did you do it, how did you do it

## Review

- Do not identify the Trust, Practitioner or Patient - can use initials
  - including trust guidelines
- DOI number

### Introduction

- Not part of the word count
- Not marked so don't start to answer learning outcomes
- Reflective model to follow
  - John's, Gibb's, Kolbs, Schwann

### Critical Reflection

- not feelings based like how you engaged with patients
- may need to refer to clinical models and frameworks to demonstrate application
  - don't need descriptions of frameworks

- compare and contrast
  - ideally require conflicting then rationalise which is correct and why

- restructure sentences if finding that you're writing in 3rd term

- appendices not marked

- don't say something is effective without supporting it

#### References

- read, understand, then write it to minimise turnitin score
- don't quote, just paraphrase

## Learning Outcomes

- 5 learning outcomes - all need to be addressed
- 600 words for each learning outcome
- prescription relevance to case

1. History taking, consultation and physical assessment skills to develop appropriate differentials and working to formulate treatment plan, reelvant to chosen area of practie, recognising limits
  - Effective 7 part history
  - Consultation models which one is most appropriate
  - physical assessment and diagnostic skills to help with differential diagnoses
  - develop differntial diagnoses and working diagnosis to formulate treatment plan
  - limitations of own practice and demonstrate how/when to seek advice or refer appropriately for support

2. outcome
  - cost effective prescribing
  - decision support tools (like CHADVASC, child-pugh)
  - cultural diversities for treatment options
    - blood products, anticoagulants containing source of animal, liquids over capsules
    - language barriers
  - wider care team benefits
    - acknowledge benefits
    - working within a team, if none required then talk about scenarios that would require

3. demonstrate knowlege of pathophysiology of disease(s) including kinetics and dynamics
  - compare and contrast the competing treatment options
  - interpret and demonstrate kinetics and dynamics and applying to case
    - need to be relevant to case
    - dose adjustments, tdm, routes of administration, impact of other pathophysiology
  - guidelines
  - public health considerations
    - health promotion (weight loss, smoking, diabetes)

4. Reflect upon ethical responsibilities of own values
  - what are factors that influenced your prescribing decision how were these factors managed
    - was a colleague influencing you
    - did patient request something in particular
  - which ones applied and how :Beachamp and Childress principles
  - were any mental capacity considerations, and aknowledge responsibility to safeguard
  - importance of reaching shared decision and address factors
