## Learning Outcomes

- Explain how impaired renal function alters the pharmacokinetics of drugs.
- Assess renal function and the limitations of the available methods.
- List which medicines and agents can be nephrotoxic and how these can cause AKI.
- Identify common medicines that need dose adjustment in kidney disease.
- Demonstrate effective management of:
  - (a) intravenous fluid therapy
  - (b) hyperkalaemia
  - (c) antihypertensive therapy and (d) diuretics in kidney disease.
- Know where to find information to guide prescribing in kidney disease.

## Key Points

- Nephrotoxic drugs often cause renal damage.
- Identifying common drug causes (e.g. NSAIDS, ACE inhibitors, and aminoglycosides) and withdrawing them is vital in the management of renal injury.
- Drug doses often need to be changed if eGFR or creatinine clearance (ClCr) falls, or in the presence of oliguria.
- Patients with hypertension and renal dysfunction need effective, tailored antihypertensive therapy.
- Intravenous fluid therapy should correct volume depletion, while avoiding overcorrection and fluid overload.
- Appropriate diuretic management is important.
- Hyperkalaemia is common in renal dysfunction, and treatment is needed to control it.
- ACE inhibitors are usually beneficial in CKD, particularly in patients with proteinuria and especially in patients with diabetes, but they are dangerous if the patient is volume depleted or hyperkalaemic.

## Acute Kidney Injury

### Causes

![AKI causes](Images/AKI_causes.jpg)

| Number | Cause | Description |
| ---| --- | --- |
| 1 | Prerenal | reversible impairment of renal function from relative hypovolaemia or hypoperfusion. Any condition reducing renal perfusion can potentially impair renal function.|
| 2 | Renal | damage within the kidney could result from more severe ischaemia, sepsis, inflammation, or toxicity (renal cells are very sensitive to inflammatory or ischaemic injury).|
| 3 | Postrenal | obstruction to urine outflow (e.g. enlarged prostate in men) causes a damaging 'back pressure' within the kidney.|

### Staging

| Stage | Details |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Creatinine rise of 26 micromol/litre or more within 48 hours; or<br>Creatinine rise of ≥ x 1.5 from baseline in 7 days ; or<br>Reduced urine output of < 0.5 ml/kg/hour for more than 6 hours.|
| 2 | Creatinine rise of ≥ x 2 from baseline; or<br>Reduced urine output of < 0.5 ml/kg/hour for 12 hours or more.|
| 3 | Creatinine rise of ≥ x 3 from baseline within 7 days<br>OR<br>Creatinine rise to ≥ 354 micromol/litre with either:<br>Acute rise in creatinine of ≥ 26 micromol/litre within 48 hours or<br>≥ 50% rise from baseline within 7 days<br>OR<br>Urine output of < 0.3 ml/kg/hour for 24 hours<br>OR<br>Anuria for 12 hours<br>OR<br>Any requirement for renal replacement therapy.|

### Optimal Prescribing

- Correct hypovolaemia;
- Minimise renal hypoperfusion (often caused by drug therapy);
- Treat other causes, such as sepsis;
- Avoid the use of (or withdraw) nephrotoxic agents; and
- Consider drugs that are renally excreted and may need adjustment.

### Drug Induced Nephrotoxicity

| Drug / Class | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Aminoglycosides | are directly nephrotoxic, causing acute tubular necrosis. |
| Amphotericin | is directly nephrotoxic. The use of newer liposomal formulations can still result in nephrotoxicity. |
| Cytotoxic chemotherapy | e.g. cisplatin, which has been associated with renal tubular damage. |
| Diuretics | can lead to volume depletion. |
| Immunosuppressants | ciclosporin and tacrolimus cause renal vasoconstriction producing ischaemia. |
| Lithium salts | can cause tubulo-interstitial damage and chronic kidney disease with long-term use. However, it should only be suspended if there is known lithium overdose or toxic levels, due to its importance as a treatment for bipolar disorder. If the situation is unclear, discuss its use with a specialist. |
| NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors | renal blood flow often relies on prostaglandins. NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors reduce prostaglandin synthesis, and cause renal hypoperfusion, and AKI. |
| Radiocontrast media | a high ionic load can produce renal vasoconstriction leading to ischaemia. |
| Other nephrotoxic agents | Synthetic agents: insecticides, herbicides.<br>Naturally occurring agents: alkaloids from plants/fungi, reptile venoms (all rare), cocaine. |

### Pathological Causes

| Cause | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Hypoperfusion | reduces oxygen and nutrient supply to the kidney. |
| Sepsis | endotoxins and inflammatory mediators from infection can damage the renal vascular endothelium resulting in thrombosis. |
| Rhabdomyolysis | myoglobin released from damaged muscles precipitates in renal tubules and also reduces blood flow in the outer medulla. |
| Hepatorenal syndrome | patients with end-stage liver disease often have renal vasoconstriction. |

### Glomerular Filtration Rate

eGFR is only good in certain scenarios, Cockroft and Gault is more appropriate when:
- in AKI
- Older adults
- Patient on a toxic medicine
- Patients at extremes of muscle mass
- Patients on a medicine with a narrow therapeutic index
- Patients on direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs)

> Glomerulus filters plasma from blood into glomerular filtrate

| Arteriole | Mediated by | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Afferent | Prostaglandins | maintain renal blood flow and GFR, especially under conditions of reduced effective circulating volume (e.g. dehydration, cardiac failure, cirrhosis). |
| Efferent | Angiotensin-II | produced by the renin-angiotensin system in response to hypovolaemia or reduced renal perfusion (e.g. with reno-vascular disease).<br>It causes efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction - using the above analogy it reduces drainage from and maintains pressure in the bath, in the face of reduced inflow. |

### Monitoring

#### Fluid Balance

| Checks | | 
| --- | --- |
| Pulse - supine and upright (where possible). You may need to sit the patient up in bed if they are unable to stand. | A rise in heart rate on standing of more than or equal to 30 beats per minute is one of the more sensitive indicators of hypovolaemia |
| Blood pressure - supine and upright. | |
| Arterial oxygen saturation. | |
| Pulmonary oedema | examine for tachypnoea, fine bilateral basal inspiratory crackles, chest X-ray signs. |
| Fluid overload | check for pitting ankle and sacral oedema. Check the patient's weight daily (rising daily weights are a very useful indicator of fluid overload). |

#### Urine Dipstick

Important to exclude a finding of proteinuria and haematuria.

### Fluid Replacement

Fluids:
- Sodium chloride 0.9% is an appropriate intravenous fluid in AKI.
- Sodium bicarbonate 1.26% is a good alternative if the patient has:
 - AKI with hypovolaemia 
 - and a metabolic acidosis (a serum bicarbonate of less than 20 mmol/litre).

| Phases | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Volume Repletion | Guided by the volume status, aim to correct any relative or absolute hypovolaemia.<br>In this phase often repeated fluid ‘challenges’ with infusion of 250 to 500 ml or more of sodium chloride 0.9% may be the best |regimen.<br>Monitor vital signs, including urine output, in an acute or high dependency environment.|
| Maintenance | When volume repletion has been achieved, adjust prescribed regimens to take account of fluid balance if the patient requires continuing intravenous fluid therapy.<br>Reduce the rate of infusion, more so if the patient remains oliguric.<br>Iatrogenic fluid overload risks pulmonary oedema and has recently been associated with increased mortality in AKI.<br>'Reflex' prescribing of up to 3 to 4 litres of intravenous fluids per day without proper fluid balance assessment is wrong and risks disaster!<br>Intravenous colloids (e.g. Gelofusine®  or albumin) do not provide any additional benefit for volume expansion and renal recovery compared with sodium chloride 0.9%.|

## Prescribing in Chronic Kidney Disease

### Staging of CKD

CKD is classified according to two parameters: the eGFR and the Albumin: Creatinine ratio (ACR) (mg/mmol).
 
In the classification table, 'G' denotes the eGFR, which is based on the previous method of classification of five categories (G1-G5); and 'A' denotes the ACR (A1-A3).

![CKD](Images/CKD.jpg)

### Drugs

| Classification | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Loop Diuretics | may reduce fluid overload and hyperkalaemia in CKD.<br>Only consider diuretic therapy in fluid overload and/or hyperkalaemia or hypertension.<br>If they are used in other patients, subsequent dehydration could result in a pre-renal state. |
| ACEi | ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin-II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) are not directly nephrotoxic and can be used in most patients with kidney disease with obvious benefits.<br>However, serious hypotension can occur on initiation in susceptible patients with renal impairment - those prescribed high dose diuretic treatment for fluid overload are at particular risk (because of relative dehydration and therefore poor renal perfusion). |

### Hyperkalaemia

| Factor | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Causes | Urinary excretion of potassium is reduced.<br>Intracellular potassium may be released. |
| Risks of not managing | precipitation of cardiac arrhythmias, and if left untreated, asystolic cardiac arrest. |
| Drugs that can precipitate | Contain potassium - e.g. laxatives (Movicol®, Klean-Prep®, Fybogel®).<br>Act to retain potassium in serum - ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs.<br>Prevent intracellular buffering of potassium - beta-blockers, digoxin.|
| Treatment | 1. Protect the heart - stabilise the myocardium. With Calcium Gluconate<br>2. Reduce serum-potassium concentration - drive potassium into the cells. Nebulised Salbutamol or Insulin<br>3. Rid the body of excess potassium - stop drugs contributing to hyperkalaemia, correct acidosis, and reduce potassium intake (Resins).|
