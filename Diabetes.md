Really impactful slide deck

### Pathophysiology

- Ominous Octet DeFronzo **add sites for drug action**
  - Decreased incretin
  - increased lipolysis
  - increased renal glucose reabsoption
  - decreased glucose uptake
  - impaired insulin secretion
  - increased glucagon secretion
  - increased HGP
  - neutrotransmitter dysfunction

Therapeutic inertia and dysglycaemic legacy


- Body unable to utilise insulin.
- High circulating glucose causing damage

### Risk Factors

- Age
- FH and genetics
- Steroids

### Signs symptoms

- Osmotic symptoms also occurs in T1
  - thirst
  - increase urine
  - renal
  - tiredness
- Vascular damage related (early control minimises risk of future complications)

### Lifestyle

- Lifestyle
- Lipids
- Platelet aggregation
- Blood Pressure
- Body Weight
- Glycaemic control

### Guidelines

#### NICE 2015

Current glucose control centric

Next guideline out for consultation

#### International

2018 guidelines
Davies MJ et al Diabetolgia 2019
Cosentino F et al EHJ 2019

#### Common drugs

##### Metformin

MOA

- reduces glycemia secondarily
- gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis
- reduces insulin resistance

Complication and Titration

- GI tolerance
  - according to tolerance to GI issues
    - diar, N&V, abdo pain
    - during initiation
    - 500 mg od then increase slowly in primary care
  - consider MR formulation
  - target 2g/day as this is the plateau for glucose control
- Lactic Acidosis
  - STOP in acute illness (AKI, liver impairment, tissue hypoxia, sepsis, day of surgery, contrast induced nephropathy)
  - If E+D for 24-48 hours then treat normally
Renal function

- renal function before initiation then yearly (3-6 month if at risk of renal impairment)
- as per SPC

Hepatic

##### Pioglitazone

MOA
- similar to metformin
- takes longer to work as it requires cellular action

##### Sulphonylureas

- good for rapid control of osmotic syptoms
- good for steroid induced

MOA

- Stimulate insulin release
  - Immediate effects
- Require functioning beta cell
  - long standing patients may not respond - consider stopping

Renal and Hepatic Impairment and frailty

  - unpredictable response so can cause hypos

#### Factors in the grid

Glycaemic Effect
Weight Gain
Hypo risk
Cardio Vasc and Renal

### New Medications

> Focus towards managing complications rather than just glycaemic control

Cost to treat diabetes related **complications** is three to for fold the **cost of medicines**

#### SGLT2 inhibitors

Empagliflozin, Canagliflozin, Dapagliflozin, Ertugliflozin

MOA

- Act in Kidneys
- Inhibit sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 protein
  - glucose homeostasis
  - responsible for 90% of glucose reabsorption in kidneys

Titration

- glycaemic control

Risks

- genitor unirary inefections
  - thrush like
- dehydration and hypotension
  - cause of osmotic diuresis and volume depletion
  - adequate hydration and BP monitoring
  - review diuretics and antihypertensives
- lower limb amputations
  - rare complications
  - existing preventative footcare
- euglycaemic DKA
  - rare but life thretening
  - sick day guidance / surgical / dehydration / starvation / ketone check
  - stop 48 hours before surgery
- fourniers gangrene (necrotising fasciitis of perineum)
 - rare but life threatening

#### Incretins

Glucagon like peptides

Hormones released after eating

increase insulin
reduce glucagon
reduce rate of gastric emptying

#### GLP1 Agonists

-atides
-glutides

Injected subcutaneously (apart from Semaglutide)

Selectively bind to GLP1 receptors

#### DPP4 inhibitors

-gliptin

Inhibits GLP1 degradation/activation
Prolongs effects by 3-4 fold
