# Anticoagulation

## Why we clot

Virchow's triad

| Disturbance | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Vascular damage | Surgery<br>Endothelial<br>Infection |
| Increased coagulability | Hormonal Factors (Pregnancy, HRT and Contraception)<br>Cancer |
| Slow blood flow | Atrial Fibrillation<br>Mobility<br>Dehydration<br>Pregnancy and Obseity |

Arterial thrombosis - platelet mediated - so use antiplatelets
Venous thrombosis - fibrin mediated so use anticoagulants

## Stroke Risk

CHA2DS2VASc

Cumulative scoring

1 year 4.0%
5 years 20.0%

## Bleeding Risk Score

ORBIT or HASBLED

Use ORBIT in NICE guidelines

Bleeds per 100 patient years

Can still anticoagulate if medium if you mitigate the causes of that characteristic (i.e. avoiding NSAIDs if NSAID related bleed, iron supplementation in low haemoglobin, stopping antiplatelets)

### HASBLED

HTN = uncontrolled

### ORBIT score
