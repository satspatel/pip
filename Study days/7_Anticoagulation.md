# Anticoagulation

## Reading

NICE CG144
BAFTA study Aspirin vs Warfarin

## Why we clot

Virchow's triad

| Disturbance | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Vascular damage | Surgery<br>Endothelial<br>Infection |
| Increased coagulability | Hormonal Factors (Pregnancy, HRT and Contraception)<br>Cancer |
| Slow blood flow | Atrial Fibrillation<br>Mobility<br>Dehydration<br>Pregnancy and Obseity |

Arterial thrombosis - platelet mediated - so use antiplatelets
Venous thrombosis - fibrin mediated so use anticoagulants

## Stroke Risk

CHA2DS2VASc

Cumulative scoring

1 year 4.0%
5 years 20.0%

## Bleeding Risk Score

ORBIT or HASBLED

Use ORBIT in NICE guidelines

Bleeds per 100 patient years

Can still anticoagulate if medium if you mitigate the causes of that characteristic (i.e. avoiding NSAIDs if NSAID related bleed, iron supplementation in low haemoglobin, stopping antiplatelets)

### HASBLED



### ORBIT score

HTN = uncontrolled

## Who to anticoagulate

- Diseases
  - AF
  - Atrial flutter
  - Continuing risk of arrthmia after cardioversion
- CHA2DS2VASc score
  - Score > 2 (> 1 in med)
  - Offer DOAC first line
  - Warfarin if DOAC contraindicated

## Venous Thrombosis

> DVT and PE

## Treatment options

Nature Review - Clotting Cascade

| Agent | Target |
| --- | --- |
| Warfarin | multiple Factors VIIA, IXa, Xa, Va, Thrombin (Factor VIIa indicated by INR) |
| Heparins | Factors Xa and Thrombin<br>But not Factor VIIa so no INR effect |
| -abans / fondaparinux | Factor Xa |
| Dabigatran | Thrombin direct |

Risk of not monitoring or not being able to monitor

- interactions - but fewer interactions so not necessary
- obesity - check Xa level if over 120-150kg to check levels - can't really do much with dose
- underweight - 50kg - can change doses easily
- risk of interactions - CYPs but haematology advice
- emergency surgical or stroke pre-thrombolysis

### Heparins

Porcine source
Sheffield don't say anything unless patient vocalises
Preferred in cancer VTE - dual action Xa and Thrombin

Unfractionated Heparin

- good for high bleed risk
- reversible on stop and fully on protamine
- renal impairment

LMWH

- parially reversible for 

### Fondaparinux

Synthetic - porcine
Longer T1/2 than LMWH - surgical considerations

### Warfarin / Vitamin K antagonist

Fuster V e al Circulation 2006

Consistency with diet, EToH

Initiating

- Coagulation screen and LFTs
  - Renal fx not a problem
- slow if frail and bleeding risk and low clotting risk
- paracetamol can affect INR
- total weekly dose = total dose required to reach INR target
  - 10mg 5mg 5mg translates to weekly 20mg so can go 3mg Mon-Sat then 2mg Sun

Maintenance

- INR takes 2-3 days to impact INR
- long term trends more important
- look for causes first
  - missed doses, interactions, clinical condition
- don't change by more than +/- 10%

Dalteparin

If both:
- mechanical valves and VTE <28 days
- INR < 1.8

Go for treatment dose BD - split dose minimises impact on increased metabolism associated with once daily doses

Stop at INR > 2 even if range is 3-4

### Direct Oral Anticoagulants

Tmax to 0.5-4 hours - so no need to bridge
Half life 10-14 hours - once daily Riva
Food with Riva - small sandwich
Riva and Edox - mucosal bleeding increased ?high peak
Apix - safer with bleeds

DVT and PE - don't thrombolyse

Higher doses initiation in DVT and PE treatment to minimise impact of pro-thrombotic state in acute phases of these conditions

| Agent | Mechanism | Pro-drug | Renal Clearance | Food | Half life | Time to max effect |
| --- | --- |  
| Rivaroxaban | Xa |
| Apixaban | Xa |
| Dabigatran | Thrombin |
| Edoxaban | Xa |

Else:

- boost dose

### Tx DVT/PE

Apix vs Riva

97 yo female 47kg CrCl 30 ml/min Hb 90

Frail and bleeding risk
Choose apix - shorter loading schedule

### Interactions

Contraindicated with P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers
NSAIDs - avoid or shortest duration and PPI cover
Antiplatelets - bleeding risk, if no ACS in 12 months, stents have an impact see ESC guidance - start/increase impact of PPI
Contraindicated in preg (give LMWH only) and breasfeeding (Warfarin ok)

### Administration

- Stomach absorbed so no jej tubes
- Gastrostomy tubes ok
- Tablets can be crushed - caps cannot be opened

Dabigatran needs dessicant so no dossetts

### Counselling

- Common side effects
  - headaches
    - can take paracetamol
  - nausea  
    - riva take with food antiemetic

- Bleeding not as common but severe
  - Signs - Stool, Vomit
  - Avoid fall risks
- Compliance same time of day, missed doses

ESC document

### Bridging DOACs

INR 2.0 is midpoint (INR 3.0 with Riva)

Switch from DOAC to warfarin
- mech valves

## Bleeding risk

Urgent with:
Prothrombin complex concentrate (clotting factor replacement) £800

Warfarin - IV/oral vitamin K
LMWH - Protamine
Dabigatran - mAB - Idarucizumab £1000
Riva/Apix/Edox - Andexanet alpha recombinant factor Xa - only severe life threatening GI bleed £17000

## Misc Facts

### Bridging patients

Dependant on risk
Two pronged approach

1. If old VTE and AF then go prophylactic pre and post op until INR in range
1. If high risk - mechanical valve or recent VTE then go full dose then prophylaxis pre surgery then therapeutic

### Falls and anticoag

Need to fall 295/year to outweigh risk of bleed outweighs anticoagulation

What's causing falls, are they injurous 

If inappropriate to be on anticoagulants

### Antiplatelets following ortho surgery

- Stop antiplatelet and restart after DOAC stopped
- Antiplatelet is for secondary prevention so risk of bleeding from dual antiplatelet and DOAC and risk of surgical related stroke
