# Renal

## Aims

- 3 stages of AKI
- CKD def and causes
- Principles of monitoring kidney function and limitations
- Knowledge of pharmacokinetics
- Nephrotoxic drugs
- CrCl and dose adjustments
- Underpinning literature and policies

## Think Kidneys

- NCEPOD report
- decline can affect kinetics and dynamics
- need to recognise
- stop and start medications
  - sick day rules

## Glomerular Filtration

- Turns blood to urine
  - Filtration excess fluid and waste
- Capillary pressure in bowmans capsule
  - Angiotensin II and Prostaglandins

## Monitoring

Glomerular Filtration Rate

- Indirectly measured using Creatinine
- Creatinine broken down in muscle and cleared by kidneys

Also:
  - Inulin
  - EDTA nuclear medicine
  - 24 hour urine collection

## Acute Kidney Injury

> Spectrum of injuries

- Decline in renal function over hours/days
- Failure to maintain fluid, electrolyte and acid-base balance

### Presentation

- Hyperkalaemia - ECG changes/ACS
  - reduced clearance and increased
- Drug related toxicity
- Pain
- Dehydration

### Types

| Pre-renal | Hypovolemia<br> |
| Intra-renal | Damage |
| Post-renal | Cancers<br>Stones<br> |

KDIGO 2012 AKI Guideline

### AKI in primary care

Need to consider reason for test:

- is this an incidental finding

True Aki:

- False positives
  - recent pregnancy - low when prenant
  - drugs - trimethoprim
  - IV fluids - low baseline in fluid resusitation
- False negatives
  - 

#### Response

Cause: where pre, intra, post
Sepsis
Hypotension

Medication:
Causing
Exacerbating
Accululation

Fluids:
Fluid balance
When last passed urine, can they manually increase, carer needs, admit for IV fluids

Review:
Admit?
When to review also handover

### Risk Factors

- age > 65
- history of AKI
- CKD/obstruction
- chronic conditions
- neurological impairment that limits fluid intake
- immunocompromised
- many more...

## Sick Day guidance

Information when well on how to manage when feeling ill

Profuse vomitting and diarrhoea

1. NSAIDs
  - Reduce flow by impact on prostaglandins
1. Antihypertensives
  - ACEi ARB
  - Diuretics / Spiro electrolytes
1. Risk of accumulation
  - Statins
  - Metformin
  - Sulfonylureas
  - Trimethoprim - hyperkalaemia

## GFR calculations

Cockroft-Gault
Abbreviated MDRD
Re-repressed MDRD
CKD-EPI

## CKD

Abnormal function and/or structure

Diabetes and Hypertension 66%
Immune and inherited for rest

## Signs

- Bruising and bleeding
  - hepatorenal syndrome and clotting factors
- taste, nausea and vomitting
  - toxin accumulation
- itching
  - urea accumulation
- lethargy
  - electrolytes

Dysfunction of Parathyroid hormone - Vitamin D

### Causes

[causes](kidneyfailurerisk.com)

### Staging

eGFR and Albumin Creatinine ratio

### Pathophysiology

Damaged tubular cells
Cellular debris in nephron

Maladaption

Adaptive repair usually in AKI

Maldaptive causes CKD

### Diuretics in CKD

- Loop diuretics
  - reduce fluid overload
  - correct potassium

Specialist advice for combined

## Dose adjustments

- Reduce dose
- Extend interval

## Hyperkalaemia

1. stabilise heart with Calcium gluconate - rapid acting short
1. salbutamol, insulin
1. clearance

## Case Study

Alendronate PIL warnings

- Determine of CKD/AKI/general tests
- can consider calcium and D3 instead of alendronate

ACEi for HTN PIL warnings

- clarify it's not Renal arterial stenosis - pre-renal
- renoprotective - reduced proteinurea
