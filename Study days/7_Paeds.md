1. Differences in ADME
1. Common paediatric prescribing pitfalls and safe principles

## Absorption

| Factor | Details | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gastric | Immature mucosa<br>Less acid pH 6-8<br>Slower emptying 6-8 hours<br>Shorter gut<br>Less Bile | Preferential for weakly acidic drugs<br>Gastric Absorption<br>Less Absorption<br>Less able to absorb fat soluble substances |
| Skin | Increased surface area<br>Well perfused<br>Good Absorption | Overdose of topical antiseptics so wash off |
| Lungs | Some receptors not developed in infants<br>Continued development after birth | beta agonists work later on |
| Rectal | Good blood supply | Good in vomiting |
| IM | Smaller muscles<br>pain due to volume | Split large doses |

## Distribution

| Factor | Impact |
| --- | --- |
| Greater Total body water | Higher volume of distribution of water soluble so less apparent concentration<br>80% Prem<br>70% Neonate<br>60% Adult<br>55% elderly |
| Reduced Plasma Production<br>Bilirubin competition for plasma binding  | Increased free drug to exert effect<br>Exacerbation of jaundice |
| Altered organ perfusion, acid base balance | Depends on Drug |

## Metabolism

Enzyme pathways take time to mature - Reaches adult levels in 6-30 months

| Pathway | Impact |
| --- | --- |
| Phase 1 | - Oxidation - CYP450 |
| Phase 2 | Glucuronidation |

## Elimination

Immature function at birth, incomplete glomerular development, reduced renal perfusion pressure, insufficient osmotic load to filter and excrete
