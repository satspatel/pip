## Absorption

| Factor | Details | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gastric | Immature mucosa<br>Less acid pH 6-8<br>Slower emptying 6-8 hours<br>Shorter gut<br>Less Bile | Preferential for weakly acidic drugs<br>Gastric Absorption<br>Less Absorption<br>Less able to absorb fat soluble substances |
| Skin | Increased surface area<br>Well perfused<br>Good Absorption | Overdose of topical antiseptics so wash off |
| Lungs | Some receptors not developed in infants<br>Continued development after birth | beta agonists work later on |
| Rectal | Good blood supply | Good in vomiting |
| IM | Smaller muscles<br>pain due to volume | Split large doses |

## Distribution

Bilirubin production increased due to increased red cell turnover.

## Metabolism

Phase 1 pathway

- Oxidation - CYP450

Enzyme pathways take time to mature

Phase 2 pathway

- Glucuronidation

Reaches adult levels in 6-30 months

- Sulphation no differences

## Elimination

Immature function at birth, incomplete glomerular development, reduced renal perfusion pressure, insufficient osmotic load to filter and excrete
