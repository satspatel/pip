## Learning Objectives

- Describe the need for evidence-based practice.
- Explain how it can improve patient safety and outcomes.
- Describe the principles of evidence-based medicine and levels of evidence.
- Explain the difference between Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) and Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR).
- Define and be able to calculate the Number Needed to Treat (NNT).
- Determine if a trial is statistically significant, using P-values and confidence intervals.
- Describe the principles of critical appraisal, and the tools required to review industry advertising critically.
- Seek appropriate evidence and interpret it effectively to aid prescribing decisions.
- Describe how evidence-based medicine is crucial in the development of healthcare policies, protocols and Trust formularies.
- Describe the role of clinical audit and the stages involved.

## Key Points

- "Evidence-based medicine is the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients" [David Sackett].
- Critical appraisal is the process by which evidence is carefully and systematically examined to judge its trustworthiness, value and relevance in a particular context.
- Clinical audit is the systematic process of evaluating clinical practice. It is necessary to assess the quality of care currently provided, to compare current practice with recommended standards, and to drive improvement.
- Hospital (and primary care) formularies aim to improve the quality of prescribing, reduce risks to patients and manage healthcare costs.
- "The next best thing to knowing something is knowing where to find it" [Samuel Johnson].
- The Summaries of Product Characteristics (SPC) are the authorised source of information on indications, dosage, warnings and adverse effects of medicines.
- UK Medicines Information (UKMi) is an NHS pharmacy based service which aims to support the safe, effective and efficient use of medicines by the provision of evidence-based information and advice on their therapeutic use.
- In order to prescribe effectively, patient values and choice, clinical expertise, and evidence-based medicine should all be considered equally.

## Formularies

- Formularies aim to improve the quality of prescribing, reduce risks to patients and manage healthcare costs by restricting the number of drugs within a class or the number of drug classes available for prescribing.
- A formulary is developed by a multidisciplinary team of health professionals. They look at the evidence for a new drug (or new indication) on efficacy, safety, and cost; compare it with other preparations in the formulary, and decide whether it should be added.
- Have you ever considered how much work goes into a formulary application?
- Not all information published about a drug is reputable or reliable, and you should be wary of taking it at face value.  
- We will now go through five simple steps to evidence-based practice. At the end of the section, you should have the knowledge and skills to critically appraise information effectively.

## Evidence Based Practice

| Step | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Define the question | Using PICO classification<br>P = Patient, population, condition, disease, problem<br>I = Intervention<br>C = Comparison<br>O = Outcome |
| Find the best available evidence | [Hierachy](Images/evidence.jpg) |
| Appraise the evidence critically | |
| Apply the evidence in practice | |
| Perform Audit| |
