| Hypertension | Raised blood pressure | Headache<br>BP >150/95 | BP > 180/120<br>Visual disturbance<br>Nausea and Vomiting<br>Chest pain<br>Stroke FAST |
| Diabetes | Reduced response to insulin, so high blood sugar concentration, this can cause complications/damage to organs | Tingling or numbness in limbs<br>Eyes blurred vision, floaters<br>Hypoglycaemia - drowsy, irritable<br>If unwell sick day rules for in event of poor eating and drinking > Gliclazide risk of Hypos/Metformin Lactic Acidosis | Hypoglycaemia - loss of conciousness, aggressive, seizures |

## Respiratory Conditions

| Condition | Description | Inspection | Trachea | Palpation | Percussion | Auscultation | Tactile vocal fremitus, bronchophony, egophony and whispered pectoriloquy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Consolidation | Likely infection within the lung. It is due to material, usually purulent, filling the alveoli | Increased SOB and resp rate | Central | Decreased expansion | Dull | Crackles/Ronchi | Increased |
| Pneumothorax | Air in the pleural cavity. This occurs when there is a breach of the lung surface or chest wall which allows air to enter the pleural cavity and consequently cause the lung to collapse. | Increased SOB and resp rate | Shifts away from affected side | Decreased expansion | Hyper resonant | Reduced/Absent breath sounds | Decreased/Absent |
| Pulmonary Oedema | Abnormal accumulation of fluid in the extravascular compartments of the lung parenchyma | Increased SOB and resp rate | Central | Equal expansion/may be reduced | Resonant | ?Fine Crackles | Decreased |
| Acute Asthma | Inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. Reversible airflow obstruction, and easily triggered bronchospasms | Increased SOB and resp rate | Central | Decreased expansion symmetrically | Hyper resonant | **Red Flag - Silent Chest**<br>Reduced Vesicular breath sounds<br>Expiratory Wheeze | Decreased/Absent |

## Diabetes
