# Consultation and History Taking

## Misc Notes

- evidence based suggests that people overestimate on ability to take a history
- need to look at theories/methodologies
- does the consultation need to be linear

## Aim

    - consise vs comprehensive
    - need to make a safe judgement on relevance

## Models

Good for base but inflexible so might miss issues.

## Basic principles of the medical consultation

- allow patient to tell story freely
  - don't interupt as may lose trust
  - document what they say is the main problem in their own terms
- use open questions
  - then focus down
- use all senses to listen
  - body language
  - visual cues
- check what you think is wrong and what your patient think is wrong
- open mind and check you're not making assumptions
- reconsider the causes that may have been decided
