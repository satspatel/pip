# Fundamentals of Pharmacology

[Guide to Pharmacology](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/)

## Learning Outcomes
- Define the following terms: agonist, antagonist, partial agonist, and allosteric modulator.
- Define, and explain the differences between affinity, efficacy and potency.
- Use graphical methods to relate dose and response.
- Define up-regulation and down-regulation of receptors and using examples, explain how this can affect the response to drugs or alter physiological behavior.
- Explain, using key examples, how drugs can act on different types of chemically sensitive sites, including: G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels, nuclear receptors, carrier molecules, and enzymes.

## Definitions

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Agonist | Chemical that binds to its target to increase its activity |
| Antagonist | Oppose the action of agonists but have no action on their targets<br>**Competative** occupy binding sites<br>**Non-competative** bind to allosteric sites or cause irreversible binding at active sites |
| Partial Agonist | Drug that has a lower maximal response and reduced efficacy at the receptor<br>Can be used instead of antagonists where full antagonism may cause problems |
| Allosteric Modulator | Don't bind to active sites but either:<br>Alter the affinity of the binding site for its agonists<br>Change the efficacy of the response when the agonist binds<br>Can cause either positive or negative effects |
| Affinity | Measure of how well it binds a chemically sensitive site, or 'receptor'<br>Binding is concentration dependent<br>Dissociation is dependant on specific receptor-drug chemistry |
| Efficacy | Measure of how well a agonist achieves the desired response |
| G-protein coupled receptors | Targets for commonly used drugs<br>G-proteins |
| EC50 / ED50 | Effective Concentration / Dose<br>Concentration Dose able to elicit 50% of the maximal response |
| Desensitisation | 
| Tolerance |
