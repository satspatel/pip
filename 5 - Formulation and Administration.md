# Formulation and Administration

## Learning Outcomes

- Describe how different formulations of a drug can differ in their pharmacokinetic properties and how this can affect dosing.
- Select the route or formulation to achieve an optimum therapeutic response and avoid harm.
- Describe how formulation change can help patients take their medicines and appreciate the value of sharing decisions with the patient when choosing suitable formulations.
- Explain how the timing of administration can be crucial for therapeutic response and safety.
- Describe the factors that should be considered when prescribing and administering unlicensed medicines.
- Describe the relevance of consent in relation to drug administration.

## Key Points

- It is important to remember that deciding on the correct formulation is every bit as important as deciding which drug to use.
- Unless you are familiar with the different drugs, routes and preparations, it's always a good idea to check the dose.
- The timing of a drug dose can be crucial to ensure the effective management or treatment of an indication. Importantly, the timing of treatment is also important to a patient's daily routine.
- In the UK, licensed preparations are manufactured to strict standards and quality tested to ensure consistency.  This is not the case for unlicensed medicines, and there may be some variation between products. 
- Before providing treatment, you must be satisfied that you have a valid authority. Patients who are considered unable to offer a valid consent are said to 'lack capacity' and must be tested against the standards outlined in the Mental Capacity Act 2005.
- If a patient lacks capacity, you can only act in their best interests.

## Considerations

| Factor | Impact |
| --- | --- |
| Patient | Is the formulation acceptable to the patient?<br>Can the patient cope with it? Severely arthritic patients may struggle with small tablets but be able to manage liquid/syrups.|
| Where the medicine is absorbed | Most oral medication is absorbed from the small bowel, which may cause problems if there is an ileus or a short bowel condition.<br>Intramuscular injections are formulated to be absorbed from muscle and subcutaneous injections from fat. Therefore, if an intramuscular injection is given subcutaneously it may not work as expected. |
| Where the medicine acts | Many medicines act at a receptor site within the body to exert a therapeutic effect, but the medicine can reach that receptor in different ways.<br> Analgesia for eye complaints can be provided topically by the administration of eye drops, avoiding systemic administration (e.g. diclofenac eye drops).<br>Vancomycin needs to be administered orally to treat Clostridioides difficile infection, yet it is not absorbed form the GI tract therefore to treat a systemic infection it needs to be administered intravenously. |
| Age Appropriate | Age and developmental stage of the child.<br>Acceptability and palatability.<br>Frequency of dosing.<br>Ease of administration.<br>Convenient and reliable administration.<br>Impact on lifestyle (e.g. will the medicine need to be given at school?)<br>Minimum exposure to excipients.<br>Whether the formulation can deliver doses variable to age/weight/BSA.<br>Route of administration needs to be acceptable to the child and their parents/carers. |

## Excipients

| Excipient | Issue |
| --- | --- |
| Aspartame | Source of phenylalanine that should be avoided in patients with phenylketonuria (a genetic disorder that prevents the breakdown of phenylalanine) (e.g. Augmentin® suspension).|
| Arachis oil | Peanuts<br>can be used as an excipient to dissolve the active drug. Arachis oil is an excipient in Colpermin® capsules and Abidec Drops®. |

## Practical Pharmacokinetics

### Oral absorption

| Factor | Impact |
| --- | --- |
| Chelation | Drugs can be bound (or chelated) to some electrolytes, particularly divalent ions such as calcium and iron, which will reduce or stop absorption. Examples include:<br>Tetracycline antimicrobials and calcium.<br>Tetracycline antimicrobials and antacids.<br>Tetracycline antimicrobials and iron preparations.<br>Quinolone antimicrobials and iron preparations. |
|Enteric coating (EC) | EC technology protects the drug from the acidic environment of the stomach or can protect the stomach from the drug. This means the drug will bypass the stomach and enter the small intestine.  This has implications for patients with an ileostomy. |
