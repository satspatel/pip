## Outcomes

- Discuss the principles and processes of gaining consent for adult patients.
- Describe the process of assessing capacity and how it is affected by the Mental Capacity Act 2005.
- Understand how the principles of consent may differ depending on the circumstances.
- Recall the [GMC guidance on ethical issues and consent](https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-guidance-for-doctors/decision-making-and-consent).

## Session Key Points

- For an adult patient to consent to treatment, you are required to provide information on the common or known serious adverse-effects or risks of medication.
- You should do your best to make sure that the patient has considered all the available options and reached their own decision.
- All professional staff involved in the care and treatment of an adult person who may lack capacity must keep a record of long-term or significant decisions made about mental capacity.
- No one else can make a decision on behalf of an adult who has capacity.
- Every competent patient has the right to refuse or consent to medical treatment including prescription medication. You must respect a patient's decision to refuse treatment even if you think their decision is wrong or irrational.
- GMC guidance states that you should not treat patients that you are close to.

## Capacity

All professional staff involved in the care and treatment of the person who may lack capacity must keep a record of long-term or significant decisions made about mental capacity. The record should show:
 
- What the decision was
- Why the decision was made
- How the decision was made - who was involved? What information was used?
- Such records provide evidence for staff if they face civil or criminal charges or complaints, and ensure you meet the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.

### Case - Daughter as interpreter

Explicit patient consent should be sought for prescription of medication and treatment, regardless of the route of administration. It is inappropriate to use the notion of implied consent for medication.

To use his daughter as his interpreter is problematic in that research has shown that family members, when acting as interpreters, do not always give the patient all of the information (albeit very often with good motives). In an emergency situation where life-saving medication needs to be given, it could be justified, as some information communicated to the patient would be better than none.

In addition, you do not know definitively that the patient would like to use his daughter as an interpreter. You may have circumstantial evidence that he doesn't seem to object to her attending with him, but it would be advisable if you were to use his daughter as an interpreter, that you obtain his permission independently for this.

You do have an ethical and legal obligation to give information to patients about their medication to the best of your professional ability. You need to try and resolve the issue of communication in order to successfully treat the patient.

Asking the patient via the daughter to return with a solicitor's letter is not wrong, but it is not the best option for alleviating the patientâ€™s pain in a timely manner.

Using a member of staff with language skills to ask the patient if he wishes his daughter to translate for him would be an appropriate course of action, as you will have obtained independent verification that the patient wishes to use his daughter as an interpreter.

If you are unsure about how to relay information to patients where there is a communication issue, then it is always appropriate to ask for advice from your senior colleagues.

### Advising on adverse events

The landmark decision of the House of Lords in the case of Chester v Ashfar [2004, UKHL 41] means that the legal standard of information required for patient consent to prescriptions of treatment is that the patient should be warned of any common adverse-effects or risks of the medicine(s) and any serious known adverse-effects.
