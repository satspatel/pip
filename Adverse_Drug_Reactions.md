## Learning Outcomes

- Define an ADR and the classification of ADRs
- Identify susceptibility factors that place patients at increased risk of ADRs
- Discuss the concepts of pharmacovigilance and its importance for public health
- Explain the role and function of the Yellow Card scheme
- Identify sources of information on ADRs

## Key Points

- Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are common and often preventable.
- ADRs cause significant morbidity and mortality, as well as being a financial drain on the NHS.
- ADRs can be classified on the basis of their dose-relationship, their time-dependency and patient susceptibilities.
- Post-marketing surveillance of ADRs for both newly-licensed drugs and well-established drugs is essential.
- The Yellow Card scheme receives reports about  suspected ADRs in the UK.
- To submit a valid report to the scheme, you need to provide four items of information: 
  - an identifiable patient
  - an identifiable reporter
  - a suspect reaction
  - a suspect drug.
- It is an important part of your role to provide clear, accurate, and relevant information about potential ADRs to your patient.

### Definition

> "An appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction, resulting from an intervention related to the use of a medicinal product, which predicts hazard from future administration and warrants prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product".

> 'Use of a medicinal product within the terms of the marketing authorisation as well as from use outside the terms of the marketing authorisation, including overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors, and suspected adverse reactions associated with occupational exposure.'

## Rawlins and Thomson classifications

| Type | Name | Features | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | Augmented | Dose-related<br>Common, predictable<br>Related to the pharmacology<br>Unlikely to be fatal | Digoxin Toxicity<br>Opioid Constipation |
| B | Bizarre | Not dose-related (within the therapeutic dose range)<br>Uncommon, unpredictable<br>Not related to the pharmacology<br>Often fatal | Penicillin hypersensitivity<br>Malignant hyperthermia and hepatitis caused by anaesthetic agents |
| C | Chronic | Uncommon<br>Related to cumulative dose<br>Time-related | Suppression to the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis with long-term corticosteroids |
| D | Delayed | Uncommon<br>Usually dose-related<br>Occurs or becomes apparent some time after use of the drug | Carginogenesis |
| E | End of Treatment | Uncommon<br>Occurs soon after withdrawl of the drug | Opioid withdrawal |
| F | Failure | Common<br>Dose-related<br>Often caused by drug interactions | Failure of the oral contraceptive in the presence of an enzyme inducer<br>Failure of therapeutic effect in patients taking anticoagulants leading to stroke |
