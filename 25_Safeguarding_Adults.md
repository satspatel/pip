## Learning Outcomes

- Describe the process whereby someone is first alerted to a concern or incident that suggests an adult with care and support needs:

  - As a result of their care and support needs, is unable to protect themselves against abuse or neglect, or the risk of it
- Describe how to respond to, and report, a concern
- Define the term 'adult safeguarding' and underlying statutory principles that underpin adult safeguarding work
- Define abuse and neglect, patterns, types and list possible indicators
Identify why some adults are more at risk from abusive behaviour
- Explain the role you must play in recognising and reporting and whom you need to speak to if you have a safeguarding concern

## Key Points

- The key aims of adult safeguarding are to:
  - Prevent harm and reduce risk of abuse or neglect to adults with care and support needs
  - Stop abuse and neglect wherever possible, and
  - Address what has caused the abuse or neglect
- The safeguarding principles are: empowerment, prevention, proportionality, protection, partnership and accountability
- All providers' core responsibility across health and social care is to provide safe, effective and high quality care

## Aims of Adult Safeguarding

- Prevent harm and reduce risk of abuse or neglect to adults with care and support needs
- Stop abuse and neglect wherever possible
- Safeguard adults in a way that supports them in making choices about how they want to live
- Promote an approach that concentrates on improving life for the adults concerned
- Raise public awareness so that communities as a whole, alongside professionals, play a part in preventing, identifying and responding to abuse and neglect
- Provide information and support in accessible ways to help people understand the different types of abuse, how to stay safe and what to do to raise a concern about the safety or well-being of an adult
- Address what has caused the abuse or neglect [1]

## Principles of Safeguarding Care Act 2014

| Principle | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Empowerment | People being supported and encouraged to make their own decisions and give informed consent. |
| Prevention | It's better to take action before mistreatment occurs. |
| Proportionality | The least intrusive response necessary to the risk presented. |
| Protection | Support and representation for those in greatest need. |
| Partnership | Working in partnership to achieve local solutions in communities where we live. Communities have a part to play in preventing, detecting and reporting abuse and neglect. |
| Accountability | Accountability and transparency in delivering safeguarding and fulfilling our duty of candour. |

## Making Safeguarding Personal

- A personalised approach that enables safeguarding to be done with, not to, people
- Practice that focuses on achieving meaningful improvement to people's circumstances rather than just on enquiry and conclusion
- An approach that utilises social work skills rather than just 'putting people through a process'
- An approach that enables practitioners, families, teams and safeguarding adult boards to know what difference has been made

## Well-being principles

- Personal dignity
- Exercising control over day-to-day life
- Physical health, mental health and emotional well-being
- Domestic, family and personal relationships
- Protection from abuse and neglect
- Social and economic well-being
- Suitability of living conditions
- Participation in work, education, training or recreation
- Contributions to society

## Decision making

The adult safeguarding duty applies to an adult, aged 18 or over, who:

- Has needs for care and support (whether or not the local authority is meeting any of those needs)
- Is experiencing, or at risk of, abuse or neglect
- As a result of those care and support needs is unable to protect themselves from either the risk of, or the experience of, abuse and neglect
- The person's inability to protect themselves **must be as a result of their care and support needs**

## Abuse and Neglect

> Everyone has a duty to respond if they are worried about abuse or neglect of an adult at risk of harm.

### Influencing Factors

- Complex interpersonal relationships; people may fluctuate in their thinking and can be unclear or unrealistic about their personal circumstances
- Unequal power relationships; this is particularly relevant in the care setting
- Social isolation; this can lead to issues such as depression
- Staff issues; organisational abuse can occur when staff receive inadequate support from management and are inadequately trained, poorly supervised; inappropriate staff behaviours, e.g. failure to respond to leadership, development of factions, bullying, misuse of substances
- Historical relationships; the effects of past relationships and personality changes
- Mental health issues; capacity to consent and make decisions

## Carers and Safeguarding

Can be involved when:

- A carer may witness or speak up about abuse or neglect
- A carer may experience intentional or unintentional harm from the adult they are trying to support or from professionals or organisations they are in contact with
- A carer may unintentionally or intentionally harm or neglect the adult they support on their own or with others

## Reporting Concerns

> Speak to your manager about whom you should talk to regarding a safeguarding concern in your organisation. If a crime may have been committed or an individual is in immediate danger, the police need to be contacted.

- When you become aware of a concern you must share information at the earliest opportunity. Any immediate protection needs for the person concerned should be addressed.
- You need to familiarise yourself with your local organisation's policy and procedures (including whistleblowing) on escalation if you are still worried
