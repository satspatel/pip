## Ten Principles of good prescribing
 
1.   Be clear about the reasons for prescribing.
2.   Take into account the patient's medication history before prescribing.
3.   Take into account other factors that might alter the benefits and risks of treatment.
4.   Take into account the patient's ideas, concerns and expectations.
5.   Select effective, safe, and cost-effective medicines, individualised for the patient.
6.   Adhere to national guidelines and local formularies where appropriate.
7.   Write unambiguous, legal prescriptions using the correct documentation.
8.   Monitor the beneficial and adverse effects of medicines.
9.   Communicate and document prescribing decisions and the reason for them.
10. Prescribe within the limitations of your knowledge, skills and experience.
 
## Learning outcomes
 
  - Describe the legal aspects of prescribing, including the prescribing of drugs subject to control under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
  - Discuss the different types of prescription documentation available in both primary and secondary care.
  - Explain what is meant by unlicensed and off-label prescribing and the role of any applicable good practice guidelines.
  - Highlight the standards expected of both hand-written and computer-generated prescriptions.
  - Discuss the importance of prescribing within the limits of your knowledge, skills and experience.
 
## Key Points
 
  - Prescribe legally and legibly, and adhere to good prescribing practice. This reduces the risk of error and harm.
  - There are additional legal requirements that must be adhered to when prescribing controlled drugs.
  - Only use approved abbreviations when you prescribe. Avoid the use of leading or trailing zeros. This reduces the likelihood of administration errors.
  - Prescribe medicines by their generic name, except in cases where there has been a demonstrated difference in clinical effect between brands.
  - When prescribing unlicensed or off-label medicines, make sure that there are no suitable licensed alternatives and there is a clear evidence base to support use.
  - Good prescribing practice adheres to formulary and to local and national policy, protocols and guidelines. Hospitals will have their own formulary to assist prescribers with their selection of treatment classes or medicines within specific drug classes. These are informed by decisions made at Area Prescribing Committees.
  - Always prescribe within the limits of your knowledge and expertise
 
## Patient Specific Directions
 
> Written instructions from a doctor, dentist or other IP for a medicine to be supplied or administered to a named patient after the prescriber has assessed the patient on an individual basis
 
## Controlled Drugs
 
### NICE
 
|Scenario|You should|
|---|---|
|Prescribing CDs|Document the indication and dosing regimen in the patient’s medical notes.<br>Assess the patient’s current clinical need, and adjust the prescription as appropriate (balancing benefits vs risks). <br>Discuss with the patient how their treatment will be reviewed and monitored. <br>Be able to discuss prescribing decisions with other healthcare professionals (e.g. pharmacist), if required (NICE NG 46, 2016).|
|Prescribing PRN CDs|Document ‘clear instructions for when and how to take or use’ the CD in the patient’s medical notes. It is also useful to annotate the prescription with the reason for prescribing or indication.<br>Annotate the dosage instructions on the prescription (i.e. maximum dose and frequency).<br>Consider any pre-existing supplies of the CD the patient may have at home prior to supplying on discharge (NICE NG 46, 2016).|
|Reviewing or Amending|adhere to local and national guidance and take into account:<br>The appropriate route<br>Dose (i.e. any dose conversions or consideration of dose equivalence)<br>Formulation<br><br>If guidance on prescribing is not adhered to, this should be clearly documented in the patient’s medical notes (NICE NG 46, 2016).|
|Multiple Routes|
If it is necessary for you to prescribe multiple routes of administration for a CD, each route should be prescribed as a separate item.<br>You should clearly document on the prescription when each route can be used and clearly cross-reference to prevent any accidental overdose by dual administration via both routes.|
 
## Licensing Considerations
 
[RPS Guidelines on Specials]( https://www.rpharms.com/Portals/0/RPS%20document%20library/Open%20access/Support/toolkit/specials-professional-guidance.pdf)
 
When prescribing you must be satisfied of the following:
 
- There are no suitable licensed alternatives that would meet the patient's needs.
- There is sufficient evidence base and/or experience for its use.
- You must be prepared to take responsibility for prescribing the unlicensed medicine and for overseeing the patient's care (including monitoring).
- Your decision has been documented in the medical notes, including the rationale for the prescription.
