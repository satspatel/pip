## Adverse events

The landmark decision of the House of Lords in the case of Chester v Ashfar [2004, UKHL 41] means that the legal standard of information required for patient consent to prescriptions of treatment is that the patient should be warned of any common adverse-effects or risks of the medicine(s) and any serious known adverse-effects.
