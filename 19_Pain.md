## Learning Objectives

- Describe how the WHO Pain ladder assists in rational prescribing of analgesic therapy for both acute and chronic pain.
- Explain the risks associated with paracetamol and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), and how these may be minimised.
- List the weak opioid analgesics available for prescribing in the UK, and when they are appropriate for use.
- Identify strong opioid analgesics, and how to minimise the risks when switching between different opioid analgesics and titrating doses to meet individual patient requirements.
- Describe the indications and cautions of Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA).
- Recall the stepwise management of neuropathic pain, and understand when a referral to the specialist Pain team is necessary.
- Describe the use of local anaesthetics in secondary care setting, and how to recognise and manage toxicity.  
- Identify patients with complex analgesic requirements where input may be required from specialist teams.

## Key Points

- The WHO ladder plays an important role for all pharmaco-therapeutic options for pain control.
- Responsiveness to analgesics varies between patients.
- There is a misplaced familiarity with the prescribing and administration of paracetamol. A familiarity thought to derive from its common use. 
- Serious and life-threatening gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity remains a major problem with NSAIDs.
- Assess patients requiring NSAIDs for cardiovascular and GI risk factors.
- In opioid naïve patients where there is no tolerance to morphine, patients may be at increased risk of respiratory depression.
- Individualisation of the scheduled opioid dose through a process of dose titration is critical to a successful outcome. 
- For breakthrough pain in patients who are taking modified-release opioids, the ‘as required’ dose has traditionally been equivalent to one tenth to one sixth of the total daily background strong opioid dose.

## Definition of Pain

> “An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage”.

## Classifications

| Type | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Acute | usually short-lived and resolves when the painful stimulus is removed (e.g. spraining an ankle, stubbing a toe).<br>It provides the body with a warning that often helps to prevent further damage.<br>The pain usually diminishes as healing progresses. |
| Chronic | pain persists despite the trauma or injury healing and is often present for more than 3 months. |
| Nociceptive | As a response to a pathophysiologic process occurring within the tissues (e.g. inflammation).<br>The pain signal originates from intact primary afferent nerves that signal noxious events, or nociceptors.<br>Nociceptors can be sensitised by release of algogenic agents (e.g. prostaglandins, bradykinin, serotonin, adenosine, and cytokines). |
| Neuropathic | In response to a pathologic process occurring along and within the nervous system pain pathways.<br>The pain signal is generated ectopically and often in the absence of ongoing noxious events by pathologic processes in the peripheral or central nervous system. |

## Assessing Pain

| Factor | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Site | where is the pain? |
| Onset | when did the pain start, and was it sudden or gradual? |
| Character | what is the pain like? (aching, shooting, tingling) |
| Radiation | does the pain radiate anywhere? |
| Associations | any other signs or symptoms associated with the pain? |
| Time course | does the pain follow any pattern? |
| Exacerbating/relieving factors | does anything change the pain? |
| Severity | how bad is the pain? |

## WHO pain ladder

| Agent Type | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Non-opioid drugs | include paracetamol and the Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). |
| Opioids | (include the pure mu (µ)-agonists and the agonist-antagonist drugs). |
| Adjuvant analgesics | are defined as medicines that are intended for indications other than pain, but can also be used as analgesics in select circumstances. There are a large number of these drugs in diverse therapeutic classes. It is important you recognise that these are used in ‘combination’ to provide a multimodal approach to pain pharmacotherapy to match the multiple sources of pain and its perception in our neurobiology. |

### Paracetamol

- Paracetamol is an effective analgesic that has antipyretic activity with no perceived peripheral anti-inflammatory properties.
- Despite being one of the most commonly used analgesics, its true mechanism of action is still widely debated. 
- Paracetamol can be administered orally, rectally and intravenously.  
- It is available over-the-counter in various oral forms (tablets, capsules, soluble tablets and liquid) both alone and in combined preparations (e.g. in cold and flu remedies) for pain and pyrexia.  
- It is well absorbed orally, reaching peak concentrations in 30‒60 minutes depending on the formulation used. 
- Paracetamol can be effective when prescribed along-side opioid analgesia. If given regularly, it can reduce opioid requirements by 20‒30%.
- The use of oral paracetamol in adults in combination with Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) can reduce overall pain scores, shorten duration of PCA use and improve patient satisfaction.

### NSAIDs

- NSAIDs are classified as COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors based on their potential for inhibiting either of these isoenzymes. However in reality the extent of inhibition of COX-1 or COX-2 tends to be a relative rather than an absolute value.
- NSAIDs which inhibit COX-1, a 'constitutive' enzyme, expressed in most tissues are thought to produce more gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity.
- NSAIDs which have selectivity for COX-2, which is induced in inflammatory cells when 'activated', exhibit less GI toxicity.
- COX-2 selective NSAIDS were developed in an attempt to reduce the high level of GI toxicity observed. However the picture seems to be more complicated with GI toxicity being multi-factorial. COX-2 selective NSAIDs have still been associated with serious and fatal GI adverse reactions, although generally the risk of GI adverse events seems lower with short-term use. Examples of COX-2 selective NSAIDs include celecoxib and etoricoxib.

#### Toxicity

| GI-related toxicity risk | NSAIDS |
| --- | --- |
| Lower | Ibuprofen and etoricoxib |
| Average | Diclofenac, indometacin and naproxen |
| Higher | Aspirin and ketorolac |

#### Considerations

- Assess patients requiring NSAIDs for cardiovascular and GI risk factors. Select an NSAID based on patient risk factors and local formulary recommendations.
- Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time to achieve symptom control. 
- Consider prescribing a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) for any patient who you assess to be at high risk of GI adverse effects (i.e. older adults, past history of peptic ulcer disease or GI complaints).
- Prescribe a PPI in patients on concomitant medicines that also increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding (e.g selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, corticosteroids).
  - Serotonin is released from platelets in response to vascular injury and promotes vasoconstriction and a change in the shape of the platelets that leads to aggregation. SSRIs inhibit the serotonin transporter, which is responsible for the uptake of serotonin into platelets. It could thus be predicted that SSRIs would deplete platelet serotonin, leading to a reduced ability to form clots and a subsequent increase in the risk of bleeding
- Avoid concomitant administration of an NSAID with warfarin (or other oral anticoagulants); this increases the risk of bleeding more than tenfold.
- NSAIDs can worsen the symptoms of asthma in some patients.
- NSAIDs are contraindicated in severe liver disease as they can worsen liver function. They can increase the risk of bleeding and cause fluid retention. In severe liver disease, renal blood flow is reliant to some extent on prostacyclins, therefore the administration of NSAIDs reduces the amount of prostacyclins in the kidney, reducing renal blood flow and leading to deterioration in renal function.
- NSAID can worsen renal function in those patients where renal function is already compromised. Avoid NSAIDs (or use with caution) in such patients (e.g. older adults and patients with cardiovascular disease). Prescribe the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and monitor renal function at baseline and throughout treatment.
