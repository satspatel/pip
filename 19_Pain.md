## Learning Objectives

- Describe how the WHO Pain ladder assists in rational prescribing of analgesic therapy for both acute and chronic pain.
- Explain the risks associated with paracetamol and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), and how these may be minimised.
- List the weak opioid analgesics available for prescribing in the UK, and when they are appropriate for use.
- Identify strong opioid analgesics, and how to minimise the risks when switching between different opioid analgesics and titrating doses to meet individual patient requirements.
- Describe the indications and cautions of Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA).
- Recall the stepwise management of neuropathic pain, and understand when a referral to the specialist Pain team is necessary.
- Describe the use of local anaesthetics in secondary care setting, and how to recognise and manage toxicity.  
- Identify patients with complex analgesic requirements where input may be required from specialist teams.

## Key Points

- The WHO ladder plays an important role for all pharmaco-therapeutic options for pain control.
- Responsiveness to analgesics varies between patients.
- There is a misplaced familiarity with the prescribing and administration of paracetamol. A familiarity thought to derive from its common use. 
- Serious and life-threatening gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity remains a major problem with NSAIDs.
- Assess patients requiring NSAIDs for cardiovascular and GI risk factors.
- In opioid naïve patients where there is no tolerance to morphine, patients may be at increased risk of respiratory depression.
- Individualisation of the scheduled opioid dose through a process of dose titration is critical to a successful outcome. 
- For breakthrough pain in patients who are taking modified-release opioids, the ‘as required’ dose has traditionally been equivalent to one tenth to one sixth of the total daily background strong opioid dose.

## Definition of Pain

> “An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage”.

## Classifications

| Type | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Acute | usually short-lived and resolves when the painful stimulus is removed (e.g. spraining an ankle, stubbing a toe).<br>It provides the body with a warning that often helps to prevent further damage.<br>The pain usually diminishes as healing progresses. |
| Chronic | pain persists despite the trauma or injury healing and is often present for more than 3 months. |
| Nociceptive | As a response to a pathophysiologic process occurring within the tissues (e.g. inflammation).<br>The pain signal originates from intact primary afferent nerves that signal noxious events, or nociceptors.<br>Nociceptors can be sensitised by release of algogenic agents (e.g. prostaglandins, bradykinin, serotonin, adenosine, and cytokines). |
| Neuropathic | In response to a pathologic process occurring along and within the nervous system pain pathways.<br>The pain signal is generated ectopically and often in the absence of ongoing noxious events by pathologic processes in the peripheral or central nervous system. |

## Assessing Pain

| Factor | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Site | where is the pain? |
| Onset | when did the pain start, and was it sudden or gradual? |
| Character | what is the pain like? (aching, shooting, tingling) |
| Radiation | does the pain radiate anywhere? |
| Associations | any other signs or symptoms associated with the pain? |
| Time course | does the pain follow any pattern? |
| Exacerbating/relieving factors | does anything change the pain? |
| Severity | how bad is the pain? |

## WHO pain ladder

| Agent Type | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Non-opioid drugs | include paracetamol and the Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). |
| Opioids | (include the pure mu (µ)-agonists and the agonist-antagonist drugs). |
| Adjuvant analgesics | are defined as medicines that are intended for indications other than pain, but can also be used as analgesics in select circumstances. There are a large number of these drugs in diverse therapeutic classes. It is important you recognise that these are used in ‘combination’ to provide a multimodal approach to pain pharmacotherapy to match the multiple sources of pain and its perception in our neurobiology. |
