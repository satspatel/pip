## Learning Outcomes

- Define medication errors, including subtypes.
- Identify individual and systems factors that can lead to error.
- Describe the role of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and NHS England in the provision of information to healthcare practitioners on the use of medicines.
- Describe how medication errors are reported.
- Describe the role and impact of electronic prescribing.

## Key Points

- Medication errors represent a significant burden of harm for patients and the NHS.
- Good doctors will make bad mistakes.
- Many errors are caused by slips and lapses, which cannot be prevented by further training, only if systems are made safer.
- Mistakes are caused by lack of knowledge and can be made less likely through education and training.
- Prescribers need to be open and honest when they make an error.
- The National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) is responsible for managing and analysing reports of medication errors.

## Definitions

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Treatment Process | Starts after the decision to adopt treatment for symptoms or their causes, or to investigate or prevent disease or physiological changes (and so includes not only therapeutic drugs but also, for instance, oral contraceptives, hormones used in replacement therapy, and radiographic contrast media).<br>It includes the prescribing, transcribing (when relevant), manufacturing or compounding, dispensing and administration of a drug.<br>It also includes the monitoring of therapy, because faulty monitoring can lead to a failure to alter therapy when required, or to an erroneous alteration. |
| Failure |  process has fallen below some attainable standard. |

| Stage | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Prescribing errors | failure to order the right drug at the right dose at the right frequency for the right patient. |
| Dispensing errors | failure to supply the right drug at the right dose at the right frequency for the right patient. |
| Preparation errors | failure to prepare the right drug at the right dose for the right patient. |
| Administration errors | failure to administer the right drug at the right dose by the appropriate route and method for the right  patient. |
| Monitoring errors | failure to check the administration and effect of a medicine. |

## Human Error Theory

| Classification | Explanation | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mistake | Error in formulating a plan of action<br>Action was executed correctly but the plan was wrong | Prescribing verapamil even though patient on a beta-blocker, unknowing of interaction |
| Slip | One or more step is executed incorrectly | Promazine vs Promethazine |
| Lapse | One or more step is omitted | Distracted and forgetting to do something |
| Violations | Reliberate - although perhaps not reprehensible - deviation from regulated codes of practices or procedures | Writing brand name instead of generic |

### Mistakes

|Action|Description|
| --- | --- |
| Knowledge-based | Require conscious analytic processes and stored knowledge in novel or unfamiliar situations where low-level rules are not appropriate. They refer to what is typically thought of as 'analytic thought'. |
| Rule-based | Involve the conscious application of specific rules to familiar situations.|

## Human Error

### Systems based approach

|Factor|Description| Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active failures | Unsafe acts or omissions that are as a result of error or violations | Confusing similar sounding drug names (e.g. prescribing clotrimazole instead of co-trimoxazole)<br>Intending to prescribe a dose of 100 mg but writing 200 mg instead |
| Latent conditions | Provide the error-producing conditions in which unsafe acts occur and can create long-lasting holes or weaknesses in the defences.<br>They may lie dormant in a system for some time before they are combined with active failures to create an opportunity for error. | Workload<br>Staffing levels<br>Lack of training or supervision<br>Communication problems between healthcare staff<br>Deficiencies in the design of technology |
