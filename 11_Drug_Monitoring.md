## Learning Outcomes

- Discuss why it is important to monitor drug therapy.
- Identify the commonly prescribed drug therapies that require monitoring before, during and after treatment.
- Describe the strategies for monitoring drug therapy, and the criteria that will determine whether a strategy is clinically acceptable.
- Identify common drugs that require Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) during treatment to avoid sub-therapeutic plasma concentrations or toxicity.
- Know where to access information on the recommendations for monitoring drug therapy.

## Key Points

- Patient safety incidents occurring as a result of a failure to monitor are completely avoidable.
- Tests for monitoring both adverse and beneficial effects should be safe, simple, precise, and validated.
- Monitoring should be acceptable to treated patients.
- You should have defined a plan of action for both normal and abnormal results.
- When interpreting results, consider the patient and what is 'normal for them'.
- Any intervention made in response to abnormal results should be evidence-based and effective.
- Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) is necessary for drugs that have a 'narrow' therapeutic window, i.e. where there is a potential for toxicity with small dose adjustments. This is particularly true if there is considerable inter- and intra-patient variability in the dose-response relationship (e.g warfarin).

## Drug Table

| Drug | Tests | Maintenance | Dose adjustment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Levothyroxine | TFTs | Annually | 6-8 weeks after dose adjustments |
| Amiodarone | TFTs | Every 6 months | |
| Combined Oral Contraceptive | BP | Every 6 months | |
| Digoxin | Heart Rate | During initiation/hospitalisation | |
| Methotrexate | FBCs | Two weeks for two months<br>monthly for four months<br>three monthly thereafter | |
| Vitamin D | plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D<br>calcium | <br> | <br>after one month |

| Benefits to patient | Benefits to NHS/Public |
| --- | --- |
|Encourage patient adherence<br>Allow patients to achieve treatment targets<br>Reduce adverse drug effects<br>Increase patient confidence in your treatment and in the healthcare system | The effective use of health service resources<br>A reduction in hospital admissions as a result of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)<br>A reduction in length of hospital admissions<br>A reduction in GP appointments |

### Do's and Don'ts

| Do's | Donts |
| --- | --- |
| Document the time of the last dose.<br>Take the sample at the correct time.<br>Document the time of sampling.<br>Follow-up the results.<br>Document the result in the medical notes.<br>Adjust treatment accordingly.| Don't monitor the serum concentration of digoxin unless toxicity is suspected.<br>Don't ignore a concentration that is within the reference range if the patient shows signs of toxicity.<br>Don't ignore a concentration that is within the reference range if there is an inadequate response.<br>Don't assume adherence. If the concentration is found to be low, check that the patient has been receiving the dose as instructed.<br>This will avoid any unnecessary dose increases, with a potential for toxicity if the patient suddenly becomes adherent. |
