# Dosing and Calculations

## Learning Objectives

- Dosing errors can have a significant impact on the patient. Neonates, infants and children are particularly vulnerable.
- There are risks associated with failing to ascertain and monitor accurate weights of children and adults. There are many online calculators to assist with imperial-metric conversions.
- One of the most common calculation errors occurs when the dose units are converted.
- Base your calculations on reputable and up-to-date reference sources and read dose recommendations carefully and in full.
- It is good practice for a second practitioner to independently check your calculations to minimise the risk of error.
- Calculated doses should not exceed the adult dose, or maximum daily dose, especially when dosing for neonates and children.
- Beware of medicines that require the dose, or the weight used to calculate the dose to be capped.
- If the product information requires the dose to be calculated on a 'per kilogram' basis, but does not specify a type of weight to use (such as lean or ideal body weight) then use actual body weight.
- Ensure the dose you have calculated and prescribed is measurable; round the dose if necessary to aid administration.

## Errors

Common errors include:

- Miscalculating the concentration of a medicine in a solution.
- Moving the decimal point in the wrong direction when converting dose units, for example, milligrams to grams.
- Over or under estimating the time interval between doses.
- Miscalculating the number of tablets to be administered.
- Miscalculating the rate of administration.

Additional risks in paediatrics:

- Doses need to be calculated based on age and weight.
- Dosing recommendations can be misinterpreted if the information is not read in full (e.g. confusion between 50 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/dose).
- Liquid preparations are often required, and these can vary in strength.
- There can be confusion between ml and mg for the prescriber or for the person administering the dose. Doses should be written in mg unless otherwise specified by the BNFC.
- If medicines are not licensed in a liquid form, the use of non-standard, unlicensed preparations can cause confusion.
- A small dosing mistake, with minimal effect in an adult, can have a significant effect in a child.

## Standards

| Approach | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Independent self-check | Carried out at away from original prescriber<br>Avoid leading questions like "this is right, isn't it?" |
| Sense check | What is the approximate answer you are expecting from the calculation?<br>Ask yourself if the dose seems reasonable to prescribe for the drug in question.<br>Check that the calculated dose does not exceed the adult dose, or maximum daily dose, especially when dosing for neonates and children. |

### Body Weight 

#### Conversions

| Imperial | Metric |
| --- | --- |
| lb | 450 g |
| stone<br>(14 lb)| 6.35 kg |

#### Descriptions

Check the SPC for which one to use

| Description | Represents... | Use for drugs that distribute into |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Actual body weight<br> (Total) | Observed weight on a set of scales<br>Good when patient not at extremes of cachexia or obesity | Fat |
| Lean body weight | Subtract body fat weight from actual body weight | Water |
| Ideal body weight | Calculated based on formula to take into account patients height etc. | Water |
| Adjusted body weight | Fits inbetween Ideal and Actual | ? |

#### Paediatric Weight

Emergency weight estimates

| Age | Formula |
| --- | --- |
| 0 to 12 months | (0.5 x age in months) + 4 (kg) |
| 1 to 5 years | 2 x age in years) + 8 (kg) |
| 6 to 12 years | (3 x age in years) + 7 (kg) |

### Body Surface Area

Used for toxic therapies, Systemic Anti-cancer drugs and antibiotics

## Essential knowledge

#### Percentage concentrations

| Units | What is 1 % | Used in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| % w/w | 1 g in 100 g | Solid and semi-solids |
| % w/v | 1 g in 100 mL | Solid mixed in Liquids |
| % v/v | 1 mL in 100 mL | Liquid mixed in Liquids |

#### Ratios

1:1000 represents 1 g in 1000 ml
1:10000 represents 1 g in 10000 ml
